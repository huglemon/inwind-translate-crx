The current version is the initial release of inWind Translate. Many additional features are planned, including:

1. Translating and explaining only selected portions of web pages
2. Vocabulary notebook for recording new words with context sentences
3. Voice explanations like a real teacher
4. E-book support

The core purpose of all our features is to help users learn languages effectively through content they find interesting. Whether it's news, books, or any material you want to understand in depth or keep up with current events.
